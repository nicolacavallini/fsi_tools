This code that I am sharing isn't meant to be or ether become a library. On the other hand I needed a modern way to share my code this is why I created this page. I said this code can't become a library. "Unfortunately" this code started as my Python playground and I would have never bet a penny that it would have taken me this far. This code isn't enough "thought in advance" to become a library. It is good enough to be shared with students and to prototype. This was my first python code, but #nonsonopoicosipirla.  

## How do I get set up? ##

This not really "software", this more "code to be shared", so you do not really need to install it. Nevertheless it relies on several popular packages that has to installed. Let's be more specific. 

### How to get the code###
Assuming you have **git** installed (if not see the first point of dependences) you can get the code  with: 
```
#!shell
git clone https://nicolaalessandro@bitbucket.org/nicolaalessandro/fsi_tools.git
```

### Dependencies: ###
  * git: the code is in a "git repository" so it can be easily shared and contributed. You should have it installed by default. If not the usual apt get should be good enought. 
```
#!shell
sudo apt-get install git-core
```
   * numpy: numerical package for python. Specific instructions are much better than what I can possibly write here. The usual sudo apt get instal might be good enough.
   * SciPy: sparse numerical package. Specific instructions are much better than what I can possibly write here. The usual sudo apt get instal might be good enough.
   * matplotlib. plotting. Why all of that work without plotting?!?! Specific instructions are much better than what I can possibly write here. The usual sudo apt get instal might be good enough.
   * Shapely: intersection of polygons. This is a bit more sophisticated. Let me postopone and elaborate later.
