This code that I am sharing isn't meant to be or ether become a library. On the other hand I needed a modern way to share my code this is why I created this page. I said this code can't become a library. "Unfortunately" this code started as my Python playground and I would have never bet a penny that it would have taken me this far. This code isn't enough "thought in advance" to become a library. It is good enough to be shared with students and to prototype. This was my first python code, but #nonsonopoicosipirla.
