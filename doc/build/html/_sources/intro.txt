``fsi_tools`` An Introduction
=============================

I didn't even want to give this code a name, but I needed to address the directory wih a name. So this is it ``fsi_tools``. ``fsi`` Because this code is not general purpose. ``tools`` in the lowest sense. I should have called it ``hammer_screw_driver`` but it  would have been too long.	

This code that I am sharing isn't meant to be, or ether become, a library. On the other hand I needed a modern way to share my code, this is why I created this page. I said this code can't become a library. "Unfortunately" this code started as my Python playground, and I would have never bet a penny that it would have taken me this far. This code isn't enough "thought in advance" to become a library. It is good enough to be shared with students and to prototype. This was my first python code, but #nonsonopoicosipirla.
