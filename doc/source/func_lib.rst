Though in general it is quite arguable to
define classes in scientific computing, one of the 
few well established type of classes are `Function Classes`_.

We do not aim at such sophistication as in dealii, but we
keep in mind scientific programming good practices. In this 
matter python helps us because it is a programming language,
matlab is not.
